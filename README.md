# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview
I created a trip planning tool using Google Maps and OpenWorldWeather APIs and Pandas to allow a user to input a minimum and maximum desired temperature for their trip. The coordinates were randomly generated as available options, and then I used pandas to select out cities that fit their desired climate. There are also maps with markers created with hotel information. To test my tool, I created a hypothetical trip to Peru where the user the Google Directions API provides trip information, as well as available hotels. The weather status in the marker represents the current weather for March 2021. This was a fun and challenging project utilizing Google APIs and my knowledge of pandas.
